Two zsh prompts that I created.

They started out as a mod of the adam2 prompt that comes with zsh (at least
it does in the Debian zsh package).

Put the files in a directory in zsh's fpath and load promptinit.

For example in your .zshrc:

--------------------------------------------------
#create this directory and place the files in it.
fpath=($HOME/.zsh/prompts $fpath)

autoload -Uz promptinit
promptinit

prompt drhl
--------------------------------------------------
